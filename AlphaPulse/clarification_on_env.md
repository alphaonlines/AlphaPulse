I cannot create the `.env` file with your sensitive Facebook API credentials as I do not have access to that information.

You need to create the `.env` file yourself in the `AlphaPulse` directory and populate it with your specific `FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `FACEBOOK_APP_ID`, and `FACEBOOK_PAGE_ID`.

Please refer to the `user_instructions.md` file I previously created for the correct format:

```
FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
FACEBOOK_APP_ID=your_app_id
FACEBOOK_PAGE_ID=your_page_id
```

Make sure to replace `your_access_token`, `your_app_id`, and `your_page_id` with your actual Facebook API credentials.
