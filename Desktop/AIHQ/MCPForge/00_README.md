## Project Overview
MCPForge is a comprehensive MCP (Model Context Protocol) learning project designed to master the MCP protocol through hands-on development of servers, tools, resources, and prompts.

## Top Priorities
- Master MCP protocol fundamentals and architecture
- Build functional MCP server with multiple capabilities
- Implement tools, resources, and prompts
- Test integration with Claude Desktop and other clients
- Document learning process and best practices

## Non-negotiables
- Follow MCP specification standards
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Maintain security best practices
- Document all code and learning insights

## Report-to
Capt. WOLFbot

## Deliverables
- Working MCP server with tools, resources, and prompts
- Test client for server validation
- Comprehensive learning documentation
- Integration examples with Claude Desktop

## Learning Phases
1. **Phase 1: Basic Server** - Set up simple MCP server with one tool
2. **Phase 2: Tools & Resources** - Implement multiple tools and resources
3. **Phase 3: Advanced Features** - Add prompts and complex functionality
4. **Phase 4: Integration** - Connect to external APIs and build comprehensive server

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Framework**: FastMCP
- **Transport**: STDIO (for Claude Desktop integration)
- **Testing**: Custom MCP client

## Change Log
- v1.0001 (2025-11-02): Initial project setup. Rationale: Starting MCP learning journey.
