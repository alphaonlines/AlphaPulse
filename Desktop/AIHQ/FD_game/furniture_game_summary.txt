PROJECT SUMMARY: Furniture-Themed Interactive Browser Game

1. **Game Concept Overview**
- Inspired by "Pac-Man", but reversed: you (the player) are the salesperson trying to catch customers who are wandering the showroom.
- Each customer has an interest meter that grows based on where they spend time (e.g., bedroom section, living room, etc.)
- Once you “catch” a customer, a mini challenge or objection-handling task pops up (like “Furniture Shuffle” or trivia questions).

2. **Gameplay Elements**
- Tasks must be balanced: if you neglect store duties (e.g., cleaning, restocking), customer volume or satisfaction drops next day.
- “Mini screens” like in Papers, Please pop up when interacting with customers (reviewing tags, delivery requests, financing, etc.)
- A leaderboard for employees/customers based on performance.
- Gamified incentives: players unlock discounts, rewards, or content based on in-game performance.

3. **Website & Branding**
- Game hosted on AlphaOnlineS or Wolf brand’s main domain.
- Use QR codes on merchandise (shirts, bookmarks, canvases) that link directly to the game.
- “Play to Unlock” logic: beat puzzles to reveal furniture and unlock special deals or coupons.

4. **Technical Setup**
- Browser-based using HTML/CSS/JS (mobile-friendly).
- Consider using a central web server to store user scores and data.
- Link or embed the game directly into Shopify/Wolf site (no extra domain needed).
- Avoid blockchain TLDs like .wolf for now due to accessibility issues.

5. **Future Game Ideas (To Explore Later)**
- Memory matching game with furniture pairs.
- Jigsaw puzzle of room setups.
- Spot-the-difference game.
- Spin-the-wheel or trivia-based mini games.
- Easter eggs tied to your other brands or stories (e.g., Reflect to Profect or 1000 Days of Poems).

This summary was compiled to revisit and build out the interactive showroom game idea in the future.
